# Orange vs the Zombombs
- Audio game made in one week for Audio Game Jam 3.
- Audio games should be playable without graphics.  This does have graphics, but they are not necessary to play the game.
- Play it [here](https://gamejolt.com/games/orange_vs_zombombs/374732).
- Voice acting by Mischa Krilov.
- All art, sound effects and music are original.
- The idea was to make it NES themed(kinda), so it uses a limited color palette and sounds.
